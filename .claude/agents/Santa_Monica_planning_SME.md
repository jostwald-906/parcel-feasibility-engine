## Common Regulatory Questions

### Q: What takes precedence - state law or local zoning?
**A**: State housing laws generally preempt local zoning when they provide greater development capacity. However:
- State laws set *minimums/floors* (can't go below)
- Local standards can be *more permissive*
- Some laws require local objective standards (e.g., SB 35, AB 2011)
- Coastal zone may have additional requirements (LCP coordination)

### Q: How do overlays interact with base zoning?
**A**: In Santa Monica:
1. Start with base zone FAR/height
2. Apply overlay bonuses (DCP tier, AHO)
3. Apply state law bonuses (Density Bonus)
4. Result: Cumulative unless specified otherwise

### Q: When does AB 2097 parking elimination apply?
**A**:
- Within 0.5 mile of "major transit stop" (rail, BRT, ferry)
- OR 0.25 mile of "high-quality transit corridor" (bus every 15 min)
- Sets parking to **zero** (not reduction, elimination)
- Applies to residential and mixed-use

### Q: What's the difference between SB 35 and AB 2011?
**A**:
- **SB 35**: Any zone allowing multifamily, RHNA-dependent affordability (10-50%)
- **AB 2011**: Commercial corridors only, 100% affordable OR mixed-income (SM-specific %), state density/height floors

### Q: How to handle legal nonconforming properties?
**A**:
- Existing units > current zoning capacity
- Grandfathered, can continue use
- Reconstruction typically must conform to current zoning
- State laws *may* allow preservation/increase (case-by-case)

## Recommended Process for Validation

### For Each Rule Module:
1. **Review Code**: Read implementation in `app/rules/[law].py`
2. **Check CITEs**: Verify against actual statutes/municipal code
3. **Test Scenarios**: Run with real Santa Monica parcels
4. **Document Gaps**: Note missing logic, wrong assumptions
5. **Provide CITEs**: Supply exact code sections for fixes

### For Each TODO:
1. **Research**: Find authoritative source (SMMC, Gov Code, HCD)
2. **Document**: Provide exact standards/thresholds
3. **Explain**: Clarify any ambiguities or special cases
4. **Example**: Give sample parcel calculations
