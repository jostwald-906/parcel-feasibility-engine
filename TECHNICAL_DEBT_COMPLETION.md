# Technical Debt Completion Summary

## ✅ All Technical Debt Items Completed

This document summarizes all technical debt improvements implemented and deployed to production.

---

## 1. PostgreSQL Migration ✅

**Status:** Complete and deployed to Railway

### What Was Done:
- Migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production scalability
- Created database models for users, subscriptions, and API usage tracking
- Set up Alembic for database migrations
- Configured Railway PostgreSQL database

### Files Modified:
- [app/core/config.py](app/core/config.py) - Added DATABASE_URL configuration
- [app/core/database.py](app/core/database.py) - PostgreSQL engine setup
- [app/models/user.py](app/models/user.py) - User and subscription models
- [alembic/](alembic/) - Database migration files

### Production Deployment:
- Railway PostgreSQL: `yamabiko.proxy.rlwy.net:42117`
- Migrations run automatically on deployment via [scripts/startup.sh](scripts/startup.sh)

---

## 2. GIS Service Caching & Error Handling ✅

**Status:** Complete and deployed to Railway

### What Was Done:
- Implemented LRU cache with 7-day TTL for GIS data
- Added automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts: 1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Implemented graceful degradation (returns stale data if GIS service is down)
- Custom exceptions for better error handling

### Files Modified:
- [app/services/gis_service.py](app/services/gis_service.py) - Complete overhaul with caching, retry logic, and graceful degradation

### Key Features:
```python
# Automatic retry on network errors
@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=1, max=10))

# Graceful degradation - returns (data, is_stale) tuple
async def get_parcel_from_gis_cached(apn: str) -> Tuple[Optional[Dict[str, Any]], bool]:
    # Falls back to stale cached data if GIS service is unavailable
```

---

## 3. Rate Limiting ✅

**Status:** Complete and deployed to Railway

### What Was Done:
- Implemented per-endpoint rate limiting with SlowAPI
- Different limits for authenticated vs. unauthenticated users
- Added API usage tracking to database

### Files Modified:
- [app/main.py](app/main.py) - Added SlowAPI limiter
- [app/models/api_usage.py](app/models/api_usage.py) - Usage tracking model
- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) - Added slowapi dependency

### Rate Limits:
- `/analyze`: 100/hour (authenticated), 10/hour (unauthenticated)
- Other endpoints: 200/hour default

---

## 4. Backend Error Monitoring (Sentry) ✅

**Status:** Complete and deployed to Railway

### What Was Done:
- Integrated Sentry SDK for FastAPI
- Configured performance monitoring (10% sampling)
- Added `/sentry-debug` test endpoint
- Environment-based configuration (only sends events in production)

### Files Modified:
- [app/main.py](app/main.py#L45-L65) - Sentry initialization
- [app/core/config.py](app/core/config.py) - Sentry configuration
- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) - Added sentry-sdk[fastapi]

### Configuration:
```python
SENTRY_DSN=https://...@sentry.io/project-id
SENTRY_ENABLED=true
SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### Test Endpoint:
- Production: https://parcel-feasibility-backend-production.up.railway.app/sentry-debug
- Triggers a test error to verify Sentry integration

---

## 5. Frontend Error Monitoring (Sentry) ✅

**Status:** Code complete, awaiting user configuration

### What Was Done:
- Installed `@sentry/nextjs@10.17.0`
- Created all configuration files
- Wrapped Next.js config with `withSentryConfig`
- Enabled instrumentation hook
- Added environment variables to [frontend/.env.local](frontend/.env.local)

### Files Created/Modified:
- [frontend/sentry.client.config.ts](frontend/sentry.client.config.ts) - Browser error tracking
- [frontend/sentry.server.config.ts](frontend/sentry.server.config.ts) - Server-side error tracking
- [frontend/sentry.edge.config.ts](frontend/sentry.edge.config.ts) - Edge runtime tracking
- [frontend/instrumentation.ts](frontend/instrumentation.ts) - Next.js instrumentation hook
- [frontend/next.config.ts](frontend/next.config.ts) - Wrapped with Sentry
- [frontend/.env.local](frontend/.env.local) - Environment variables

### Features Configured:
- ✅ Performance monitoring (10% sampling)
- ✅ Session replay (10% of sessions, 100% on errors)
- ✅ Privacy protection (mask all text, block all media)
- ✅ Browser extension error filtering
- ✅ Development mode filtering (doesn't send events locally)

### Setup Guide:
Complete setup instructions available in [frontend/SENTRY_SETUP.md](frontend/SENTRY_SETUP.md)

### Pending Action:
User needs to:
1. Create Sentry frontend project at https://sentry.io
2. Get DSN and add to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://xxxxx@sentry.io/project-id
   SENTRY_ORG=your-org-slug
   SENTRY_PROJECT=parcel-feasibility-frontend
   ```
3. Restart dev server

---

## 6. Deployment Infrastructure ✅

**Status:** Complete and production-ready

### What Was Done:
- Created [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for Railway deployment
- Created [scripts/startup.sh](scripts/startup.sh) with graceful migration handling
- Configured [railway.json](railway.json) with health checks
- Set up all environment variables on Railway

### Key Features:
- Automatic database migrations on deploy
- Graceful handling of already-applied migrations
- Health check endpoint: `/health`
- Restart policy: ON_FAILURE with 10 max retries

### Production URLs:
- **Backend API:** https://parcel-feasibility-backend-production.up.railway.app
- **Health Check:** https://parcel-feasibility-backend-production.up.railway.app/health
- **API Docs:** https://parcel-feasibility-backend-production.up.railway.app/docs
